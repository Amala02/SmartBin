# SmartBin

This is the software code of the project: SmartBin
We developed a Smart Bin prototype with a dashboard for displaying Temperature, Humidity, Oxygen
gas content and status of lid in real time to users.
Features:
- User friendly dashboard with stats displaying data to users.
-  Presented in the Tancam Womenâ€™s hackathon 2024
-  Helps analyze if optimal conditions for composting waste have been made and automatically
- Displays data on the dashboard. Also closes the bin once the waste level is full.
